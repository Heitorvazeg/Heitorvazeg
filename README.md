## Hi there 👋 I'm Heitor Vaz

I’m a **Software Engineer** and **Software Engineering student at the Federal University of Goiás (UFG)**.  
My journey in technology began with a **technical program in Data Science**, where I discovered my passion for **logical problem-solving** and had my first hands-on experience with tools like **Python** and **SQL**.

Since entering university, I’ve been deepening my knowledge through **academic projects, personal initiatives, freelance work, and innovation-driven experiences**, always focused on applying technology to **real-world problems** rather than purely theoretical solutions.

I actively explore **Backend Development**, **Web Systems**, and **Artificial Intelligence**, including **automation and intelligent agents**, with a strong emphasis on **software architecture, scalability, efficiency, and clean engineering practices**.

My participation in **hackathons, ideathons, programming competitions, and innovation incentive programs** has strengthened my ability to work in multidisciplinary teams, rapidly prototype solutions, and transform ideas into viable products with real impact.

I believe in computing as a **tool for social transformation** and aim to create solutions that generate **positive, scalable, and sustainable impact**.
